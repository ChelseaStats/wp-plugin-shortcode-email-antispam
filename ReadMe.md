> WordPress Plugin to add antispam function to email shortcode

##### Displaying an email address on a page or in a post

<p>Emails, especially with a mailto link like the one below  can attract a lot of spam
<pre>&lt;a href="mailto:someaddress@domain.tld"&gt;someaddress@domain.tld&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
To combat this you can use some code that obfuscates the email address but still displays nicely to humans</p>
simply, on your page, use this shortcode and we will take care of the rest, it will look like this in the editor, but will look fine in the preview and when published</p>
<pre>[email]someaddress@domain.tld[/email]</pre>
<p>Got a subject you want adding to the email? use this:
<pre>[email]someaddress@domain.tld|subject goes here[/email]</pre>
